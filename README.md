## Setup

After installation, click the extension icon in the toolbar to open the side panel. A setup wizard will guide you through connecting to your Azure DevOps project.

### Step 1 — Welcome

The wizard offers two ways to get started:
- Click **Get Started** to enter your details step by step
- **Or** paste your Azure DevOps URL (e.g. `https://dev.azure.com/my-org/my-project`) to auto-fill the organization and project, skipping straight to the PAT step

![Welcome screen](wizard-welcome.png)

> **URL shortcut:** Copy any URL from your Azure DevOps browser tab and paste it into the URL field. The extension will extract the org and project for you.

### Step 2 — Organization

Enter your Azure DevOps organization name. This is the part after `dev.azure.com/` in your URL.

### Step 3 — Project

Enter the name of the Azure DevOps project you want to track work items from.

### Step 4 — Access Token

Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) and paste it in. The wizard includes an expandable guide if you need help creating one.
